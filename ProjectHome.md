the Netgear N300 Wireless N USB dongle can be hard to get working in linux so i made this to install the windows drivers with ndiswrapper

this will also install the drivers for anything that uses the bcmwlhigh5 driver (bcmwlhigh5.ini and bcmwlhigh5.sys)

there is currently online and offline install methods
